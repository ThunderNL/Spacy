This is a remake of my original Spacy game, that was made in Microsoft MakeCode Arcade, this version is written in LÖVE for Lua.

The controls are pretty simple, use 'W' or '↑' to move up, and 'S' or '↓' to move down. You can shoot with 'space', 'return', 'lshift' or 'rshift'. Maybe I'll add mobile and controller support someday.

Sound is also a W.I.P.
